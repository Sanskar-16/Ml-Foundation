# Ml-Foundation

This repository consists of all the labs and exercises for this course I took on the 'foundations of Machine Learning' on Youtube.

## Visualisation 
In order for the visualise the data in the last lab file, follow these steps:
1. Download the visualisation folder, containing vecs.tsv and meta.tsv files.
2. Go to this link - !(Embedded projector)[https://projector.tensorflow.org/] and load the vector and meta files in their respective boxes.
3. Do check the 'Spereize data' option, it is pretty cool!
